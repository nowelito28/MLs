## Python applied to Machine Learning (MLS) an Neuronal Networks (NNs)

Machine learning projects designed by Python libraries as PyTorch, Sklearn, etc. Theorical and practical funcionalities 
with diferent data bases based on some examples in biomedical applications, using a wide variety of types of automatic thinking;
roughly with classification, regression and neuronal networks.
